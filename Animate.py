# CSC3022F - RL Assignment 2
# May 2021
# This file contains the generateAnimat function that generates an animation of 2D array data.
# The function can also generate an animated gif so if you are having trouble getting things to work in your terminal,
# you can view your results from the generated file.
# The 'col' parameters make assumptions about the size of the rewards you give your agents. You may need to change their values to generate an animation with 
# clearly identifiable start and end states.
# The final frame of the animation showcases the supplied optimal policy as it would be executed by the agent on the given environment.
# The function also assumes that the last record represents the iteration/epoch where, in the case of Value Iteration, convergence was DETECTED and
# in the case of Q-Learning, the last record is the last epoch on the learning algorithm

# Don't forget to turn off interpolation when viewing these animations or else each cell will not be easily identifiable.
